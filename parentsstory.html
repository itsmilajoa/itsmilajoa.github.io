  My mother and father have crossed the border a couple of times, they’ve been robbed out of tens of thousands of dollars from ‘lawyers’ and left their families behind for over 15 years. I remember growing up going to law offices with my mother carrying a very full backpack full of documents and taxes. My father has told me his story of crossing the border one of the times when he got caught on the barbed wire by his shoelace for helping a pregnant lady because border patrol was right behind them, and my father left his shoe behind while my parents still had a long way to go. My mother crossed the border pregnant with me in her stomach. My parents crossed with my godparents and after they all made it, around 15 people had to fit in a small truck bed.

  My parents have mentioned how hot it can get and how freezing the night was, especially in “El Rio Bravo”. My mother almost drowned while my father helped her stay afloat. My parents were being held captive in a coyote’s home for about a week or so before they managed to escape. I never knew till this day as to why they were held captive. My father’s side of his family has mostly crossed the border through the years and has all made it safely. My mother is the only one in her family who has crossed. In Mexican culture, family is above everything else.

  My parents dreamed of the American Dream for themselves but most importantly for their future children which is my brother and me. I grew up never in fear of my parents being taken away from me because my parents shielded us from that information and always held their faith close to their hearts thankfully after coming here for so many years, they were granted their residency/green card back in 2013. My parents have been through blood, sweat, and tears fighting as hard as they can in order to find their place in a country that is threatened by us. Now in 2022, hopefully by the end of this year, my parents will receive their US citizenship. I am a first-generation college graduate and this fall I will be the first in my family to recieve my Bachelors degree. I have always felt like it was my job as their daughter is to be their voice and the voice for many. I want to represent my Mexican roots and fight alongside those who are being shut out in a country whose jobs are to shut out every race and have a white America. 
</p>
<p>
  It’ll always be a fight between us and them, the true Americans and us the Mexicans or Hispanics, the natives and us the enemies, those who are legit and the illegals. We are the Other in this country.
